### I made the workshop for my lab of bench scientists in 2016. The good old days of learning together.

### 1-1 introduces the most widely used sequencing methods and how libraries are made. Understanding the experiment procedures helps one to decide what to do during data processing!!

### 1-2 introduces high performance computing clusters and sequencing data analysis workflow. The actually processing scripts can be found in the Fuller_Lab_paper repository.
